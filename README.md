# The following exercises will give you more practice with creating classes and managing state.

Create two function components: Input and Ouput

    The Input component should show a label (that says "type here") and a text input element

    The Output component should show an empty div

Import these into your App component

Change the App component to a class

In App's constructor, add a state property with a single key: textValue

    Give textValue a value of "this is the text value in state"

Pass the textValue state property as a prop to the Input and also to the Output

    In your Input component, use the prop as the value of the text input element

    In your Output component, display the prop in the div

Give App a helper function "_updateText" that receives a string as an argument and calls setState() to update the textValue in App's state

Pass "_updateText" as a second prop to the Input component

Use the prop as the onChange of the text input element

Make sure that as you type into the Input also appears in the Output

Bonus feature #1: create a ClearInput component that contains a button. When the button is clicked, the text in the Input and the Output should be empty 

Bonus feature #2: create an UpperCaseOputput component. Pass the textValue state property to it. It should display the same text, but in uppercase.
